Simulation started on: Fri May 14 12:37:17 2021
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0002 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
