Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 5

Pt DC convergence is used.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during TRAN analysis `SP1'.
    COMPONENT `X2.em_data':
       Simulator uses frequency lower than frequency range of model. The S-parameters are extrapolated.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during TRAN analysis `SP1'.
    COMPONENT `X2.em_data':
       S-parameter passivity is enforced.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during TRAN analysis `SP1'.
    COMPONENT `LNA2.X2.em_data':
       Simulator uses frequency lower than frequency range of model. The S-parameters are extrapolated.

SP SP1[1] <HW_lib:Main:schematic>   freq=(7 GHz->10 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The DC (0 Hz) value has not been specified in the Touchstone file
    'H:/ADS_HW/HW_wrk/data/Components/MFliter_8.5GHz_Mom_MFilter_0.5GW.s2p'.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `H:/ADS_HW/HW_wrk/data/Components/MFliter_8.5GHz_Mom_MFilter_0.5GW.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Noise data in the Touchstone file `H:/ADS_HW/HW_wrk/data/Components/MFliter_8.5GHz_Mom_MFilter_0.5GW.s2p'
    does not cover the current value of `freq'. Therefore, if noise
    simulation is requested the data will be obtained by extrapolation.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    COMPONENT `LNA2.X2.em_data':
       Simulator uses frequency higher than frequency range for model. The S-parameters are extrapolated.
