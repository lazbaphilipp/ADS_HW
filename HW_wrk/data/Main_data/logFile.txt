Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 5

Pt DC convergence is used.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during TRAN analysis `SP1'.
    COMPONENT `OT.em_data':
       Simulator uses frequency lower than frequency range of model. The S-parameters are extrapolated.

    COMPONENT `OT.em_data':
       S-parameter passivity is enforced.

SP SP1[1] <HW_lib:Main:schematic>   freq=(7 GHz->10 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The DC (0 Hz) value has not been specified in the Touchstone file
    'C:/Users/ntuser/Desktop/ADS_HW/HW_wrk/data/Components/MFliter_8.5GHz_Mom_MFilter_0.5GW.s2p'.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/ntuser/Desktop/ADS_HW/HW_wrk/data/Components/MFliter_8.5GHz_Mom_MFilter_0.5GW.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Noise data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/ntuser/Desktop/ADS_HW/HW_wrk/data/Components/MFliter_8.5GHz_Mom_MFilter_0.5GW.s2p'
    does not cover the current value of `freq'. Therefore, if noise
    simulation is requested the data will be obtained by extrapolation.
